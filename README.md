# Human-Activity-Recognition

If GitHub takes too long to load the notebook, or when multiple refresh is needed to properly render the contents of the notebook, please try the Jupyter nbViewer link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anthonywu2000/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/a93e835dda96a56bef807f3fbf3e0c297443f673/Human_Activity_Recognition_Algorithms_Project.ipynb

A Python script of the notebook will be released sometime later!
